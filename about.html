        <!--Paragraph About Me-->
            <p>My name is Alyssa and I am currently an undergraduate student at Robert. H. Smith School of Business
                at University of Maryland. I am pursuing a bachelors in information systems and marketing.
                Growing up, you could always find me fixing a jigsaw puzzle. A rather dated hobby for a kid.
                Upon being introduced to technology, I soon realized coding is a lot like a puzzle.
                Itâ€™s envisioning an end result and putting together the right pieces to get there.
                I saw information systems as a way to challenge myself in the technological realm
                while feeding my interest of solving problems. I am currently developing my skills
                in excel, python and SQL.</p>

        <!--Paragraph 2 About Me-->
            <p>In both my personal and professional life I have learned to overcome the intimidation
            of taking the first step. I have learned patience, flexibility and adaptability.
            Each day I strive to fall in love with practicing and bettering my skills and hobbies because
            I know that is the only way I can grow to be better. </p>
